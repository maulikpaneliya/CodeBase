Here is a special prompt you can use next time to instantly continue your **Codebase repository** work without re-explaining everything:

**🚀 Prompt:**  
*"Continue Codebase Golang snippets project"*

### 🧠 **What I Will Remember:**
- You are building an **open-source repository named "Codebase"** to learn new programming languages.  
- The repository contains **snippets, cheat sheets, and ready-to-use methods/functions** for quick learning and faster development.  
- You have already started with **Golang snippets** and created files like `DB_Helper.go`, `Array_helper.go`, `String_helper.go`, etc.  
- Each `.go` file contains **basic-to-advanced methods** with proper examples and comments.  
- Your repository structure follows a clear format (e.g., `Golang/snippets/filename.go`).  
- You want **clean, well-documented code with examples** for easy learning.  

### ⚙️ **Next Time:**  
Simply say:  
**"Continue Codebase Golang snippets project"**  
…and I will pick up from where we left off! 🚀😊
